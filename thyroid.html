    <br>
    <br>
    <b><p style="font-size:30px;">What exactly is thyroid and it's role?</p><br></b>
    <p>
        The thyroid gland is a small organ that's located in the front of the neck, wrapped around the windpipe (trachea).<br>
         It's shaped like a butterfly, smaller in the middle with two wide wings that extend around the side of your throat. Your thyroid creates and produces<br> hormones that play a role in many different systems throughout your body.
         When your thyroid makes either too much or too little of these<br>  important hormones, it's called a thyroid disease.</p>
         Your thyroid has an important job to do within your body — releasing and controlling thyroid hormones that control metabolism. <br>Metabolism is a process where
        the food you take into your body is transformed into energy.<br> This energy is used throughout your entire body to keep many of your body's systems working correctly.
         <br>
         <br> 
         <b>There are mainly 2 Types of Thyroid:</b><br>
    <ul class="main-content-list">
        <br>
        <li><b>Hyperthyroidism:</b> This is when the thyroid produces an excessive quantity of thyroid hormones.<br>
             The underlying cause of hyperthyroidism may be Graves' disease or an overactive thyroid.
        </li>
        <br>
        <li><b>Hypothyroidism:</b> This is when thyroid hormone production is too low.<br>
             This is often caused by an autoimmune disease that has damaged the thyroid.</li>

        <div><img src="picture/thyroid.gif.gif" alt="Thyroid" class="gif-image" /></div>
        <br>
        <ol style="margin-left:10px;line-height:30px">
            <h2><b>STEPS:</b></h2><br>
            <li>You can use a folded towel or blanket under your shoulders for support.</li>

            <li>On an inhale, lift your legs up to ninety degrees.</li>
            <li>Slowly exhale and bring your legs over your head.</li>
            <li>Your feet can balance in the air.</li>
            <li>Bring your hands to your lower back to support your body.</li>
            <li>Keep your fingers pointing up toward your hips with your pinky fingers on either side of your spine.</li>
            <li>Raise your legs straight up toward the ceiling.</li>
            <li>Aim to keep your shoulders, spine, and hips in one line if it’s possible.</li>

        <br>
        <div class="benefits0fposes" style="line-height:30px;">
            <h2>Benefits: </h2><br> 
            <p>Shoulderstand is often the first pose that's suggested to treat the thyroid. Since it's an inversion, it stimulates<br> blood flow to the glands in the upper body.
                 This is believed to have a positive effect on the efficiency of the thyroid.<br>
                 Additionally, the way your chin is tucked into your chest in this position is believed to benefit thyroid function.</p>
        </div>
        <br>
        <br>

        <li><b>Halasana (Plow pose)</b></li><br>
