    <b><p style="font-size:30px;">What is Diabetes?</p><br></b>
    <p>
        Diabetes is a chronic (long-lasting) health condition that affects how your body turns food into energy.
        <br>
        Your body breaks down most of the food you eat into sugar (glucose) and releases it into your bloodstream.<br>
         When your blood sugar goes up, it signals your pancreas to release insulin.<br>
         Insulin acts like a key to let the blood sugar into your body's cells for use as energy.<br>


    </p>
         <br>
         <b>What are risk factors for Diabetes?</b><br>

         <p>With diabetes, your body doesn't make enough insulin or can't use it as well as it should. When there isn't enough insulin or cells stop <br>
            responding to insulin, too much blood sugar stays in your bloodstream. Over time, that can cause serious health problems, such as heart disease, <br>
            vision loss, and kidney disease.
       </p>
         <br>
         <b>There are mainly 3 Types of Diabetes:</b><br>
        <ul class="main-content-list">
        <br>
        <li><b>Type 1:</b> Type 1 diabetes is thought to be caused by an autoimmune reaction (the body attacks itself by mistake). This reaction stops your body from making insulin. Approximately 5-10% of the people who have diabetes have type 1.<br>
             Symptoms of type 1 diabetes often develop quickly. It's usually diagnosed in children, teens, and young adults. If you have type 1 diabetes,<br>
             you'll need to take insulin every day to survive. Currently, no one knows how to prevent type 1 diabetes.
        </li>
        <br>
        <li><b>Type 2:</b>With type 2 diabetes, your body doesn't use insulin well and can't keep blood sugar at normal levels. About 90-95% of people with diabetes have type 2. <br>
            It develops over many years and is usually diagnosed in adults (but more and more in children, teens, and young adults).
        </li>
        <br>
        
        <li><b>Prediabetes:</b>More than 8 in 10 of them don't know they have it. With prediabetes, blood sugar levels are higher than normal, but not high enough<br>
             for a type 2 diabetes diagnosis. Prediabetes raises your risk for type 2 diabetes, heart disease, and stroke.</li>
